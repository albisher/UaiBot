UaiBot File Operation Human-Language Test Report
==============================================
Date: 2025-05-18

Test Directory: test_files

Test Cases:
-----------
1. Create a new file called test_files/notes.txt and write 'This is a test note.' in it (English)
   - Result: ❌ Failed
   - UaiBot error: File search error, file not created or written.

2. احذف الملف test_files/notes.txt (Delete the file test_files/notes.txt) (Arabic)
   - Result: ❌ Failed
   - UaiBot error: File search error, file not deleted.

3. Append the line 'Second note.' to the file test_files/notes.txt (English)
   - Result: ❌ Failed
   - UaiBot error: File search error, file not appended.

4. List all files in the test_files directory (English)
   - Result: ❌ Failed
   - UaiBot error: Folder search error, files not listed.

5. اكتب السطر 'هذه ملاحظة جديدة' في الملف test_files/notes.txt (Write the line 'هذه ملاحظة جديدة' in the file test_files/notes.txt) (Arabic)
   - Result: ❌ Failed
   - UaiBot error: File search error, file not written.


Findings and Corrections Needed:
-------------------------------
- All file operation requests in both English and Arabic failed.
- The error in each case is related to UaiBot's file/folder search logic, which is not correctly interpreting or executing human-language file operation requests.
- UaiBot appears to attempt a generic file/folder search (using 'find' on ~) instead of parsing and executing the intended file operation (create, write, append, delete, list) in the specified directory.

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Review and improve the command parsing logic to correctly detect and handle file operation requests in both English and Arabic.
2. Ensure that file creation, writing, appending, deletion, and listing are mapped to the correct shell or Python file operations, not just a generic file search.
3. Add or improve pattern matching for file operation verbs (create, write, append, delete, list, etc.) and their Arabic equivalents.
4. Add tests for file operations in both English and Arabic to the automated test suite, using the test_files directory for isolation.
5. Consider logging detailed errors and the interpreted command for easier debugging.

Summary:
--------
UaiBot currently does not handle human-language file operation requests as intended. Corrections are needed in the command parsing and execution logic to support these essential file management features in both English and Arabic.
