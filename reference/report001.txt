# UaiBot Alignment Report: idea.txt & enhancements*.txt vs. Implementation

## 1. Command Help Coverage
**Planned:** Comprehensive help for all commands, including new categories and examples (see enhancements2.txt).
**Current:** `core/command_help.py` covers many commands, but not all categories or new commands from enhancements2.txt.
**Action:**  
- Review `core/command_help.py` and add missing commands/categories/examples as per enhancements2.txt.
- Ensure all commands in the enhancements are present with proper syntax and examples.

## 2. Platform-Specific Command Mapping
**Planned:** Platform-specific command templates for Mac, Ubuntu, Jetson, etc. (see enhancements2.txt and idea.txt).
**Current:** `core/platform_commands.py` covers Mac, Ubuntu, Jetson, but may lack some new mappings (e.g., new file/network/system commands).
**Action:**  
- Compare enhancements2.txt mappings with `PLATFORM_COMMANDS` in `core/platform_commands.py`.
- Add any missing command templates or categories.

## 3. Safe Command Whitelist
**Planned:** Expanded and categorized safe command whitelist (see enhancements2.txt).
**Current:** `core/shell_handler.py` and related files have a large whitelist, but may not match the latest enhancements.
**Action:**  
- Ensure all commands in enhancements2.txt are present in `SAFE_COMMAND_WHITELIST` in `core/shell_handler.py`.
- Remove any obsolete commands not in the approved list.

## 4. Folder/Notes Finder Logic
**Planned:** Enhanced `find_folders` to support cloud/local notes, platform-specific logic, and improved output (see enhancements.txt).
**Current:** Multiple versions of `find_folders` exist; main logic is in `core/shell_handler.py` and helpers.
**Action:**  
- Ensure the main `find_folders` method matches the latest fixed/enhanced version (see `core/fixed_find_folders.py` and enhancements.txt).
- Remove old/duplicate logic and unify to the approved version.

## 5. Command Routing & Context Detection
**Planned:** Smarter routing of commands (local vs. screen/USB), improved detection of intent/context (see enhancements3.txt).
**Current:** `command_processor/command_processor.py` and `core/command_detector.py` handle routing, but may not cover all new patterns.
**Action:**  
- Review enhancements3.txt for new routing/detection patterns.
- Update `command_processor/command_processor.py` and `core/command_detector.py` to cover all described scenarios and edge cases.

## 6. Test Coverage
**Planned:** Tests for all new features and edge cases (see enhancements4.txt).
**Current:** Many test scripts exist, but may not cover all enhancements.
**Action:**  
- Review enhancements4.txt and add/expand tests in `/tests/` to cover all new/changed behaviors.

## 7. User Interface/UX
**Planned:** Dual window GUI, clear feedback, safe mode toggling, etc. (see idea.txt and enhancements5.txt).
**Current:** GUI code exists in `/backup/gui/main_window.py.new`, but may lack some planned features.
**Action:**  
- Compare enhancements5.txt and idea.txt with GUI code.
- Add missing features (e.g., safe mode toggle, clearer feedback, etc.).

## 8. Documentation & Examples
**Planned:** Up-to-date documentation and usage examples for all features (see idea.txt).
**Current:** Some docstrings and comments, but may not be comprehensive.
**Action:**  
- Update docstrings and add usage examples where missing, especially for new/changed features.
