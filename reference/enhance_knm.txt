You can control your operating system’s mouse and keyboard using Python by leveraging libraries such as PyAutoGUI and keyboard. These libraries allow you to programmatically simulate mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard input from the command line interface (CLI) or within scripts.

## Controlling Mouse and Keyboard with Python

**PyAutoGUI** is the most popular cross-platform library for this purpose. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and provides a simple API for automating mouse and keyboard actions[1][2][5].

### Installation

Install PyAutoGUI using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

Optionally, for more advanced keyboard control, you can also install the `keyboard` library:

```bash
pip install keyboard
```

### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use PyAutoGUI to control your mouse and keyboard:

```python
import pyautogui

# Move the mouse to coordinates (100, 150)
pyautogui.moveTo(100, 150)

# Click the mouse at the current position
pyautogui.click()

# Type text with a short interval between each character
pyautogui.write('Hello, world!', interval=0.25)

# Press the 'esc' key
pyautogui.press('esc')

# Hold down the shift key and press the left arrow four times
with pyautogui.hold('shift'):
    pyautogui.press(['left', 'left', 'left', 'left'])

# Press a hotkey combination (Ctrl+C)
pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c')
```


### Additional Libraries

- **keyboard**: For more advanced keyboard event handling (Windows and Linux only)[6].
- **mouse**: For direct mouse control, including event hooks and hotkeys[7].

### Notes

- All actions can be scripted and run from the CLI using `python script.py`.
- These libraries allow you to automate almost any interaction you could perform manually with a mouse or keyboard[1][5].
- For security reasons, some platforms may require your script to be run with administrator privileges.

## Summary Table

| Library      | Mouse Control | Keyboard Control | Cross-Platform | CLI Usable |
|--------------|:-------------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:----------:|
| PyAutoGUI    | Yes           | Yes              | Yes            | Yes        |
| keyboard     | No            | Yes              | Partial        | Yes        |
| mouse        | Yes           | No               | Partial        | Yes        |

Using these tools, you can control your OS as if you were using a mouse or keyboard physically, all from Python scripts run via the CLI[1][2][5][7].
