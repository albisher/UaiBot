- AI Model Architecture:
  * Design for model-agnostic architecture
  * Support multiple AI providers and models
  * Allow easy switching between different models
  * Maintain consistent interface regardless of model
  * Design for future model upgrades/changes
  * Support model-specific optimizations

- Current Implementation:
  * Using Ollama with gemma3:latest as initial model
  * This is a temporary implementation choice
  * Architecture must support other models
  * No hard dependencies on specific model features
  * Keep model-specific code isolated
  * Allow for easy model replacement
  * Currently no regex code is allowed before the ai model reply

- Command Processing:
  * Follow the command processing pipeline
  * Implement proper error handling
  * Maintain clear separation between interpretation and execution
  * Document all command patterns
  * Ensure proper validation of model responses
  * Support model-agnostic command patterns
