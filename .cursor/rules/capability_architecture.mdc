# Labeeb Capability Architecture (MDC)

This document outlines the architecture and design principles for Labeeb's capability system.

## Core Principles

1. **Composability**
   - Capabilities should be built from atomic tools
   - Capabilities should be composable to build complex workflows
   - Capabilities should be independent and self-contained

2. **Discoverability**
   - Capabilities must be well-documented
   - Capabilities should be easily discoverable by Labeeb
   - Capabilities should have clear input/output specifications

3. **Reliability**
   - Capabilities must handle errors gracefully
   - Capabilities should provide meaningful error messages
   - Capabilities should be thoroughly tested
