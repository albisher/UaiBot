# Learning Mechanism Rules

## Overview
UaiBot uses a learning mechanism to improve its performance over time. This document outlines the rules and best practices for using this mechanism.

## Rules

1. **Log Command Results:**
   - Every command result must be logged into the knowledge base, even if the command succeeds.
   - Include the capability, OS, action, and command pattern in the log.

2. **Suggest Alternatives:**
   - If a command fails, UaiBot must suggest reliable alternatives based on the knowledge base.
   - Alternatives should be context-aware and relevant to the current OS.

3. **Knowledge Base Structure:**
   - The knowledge base must be stored in a JSON file, with a clear structure for capabilities, OS, actions, and command patterns.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "mouse_control": {
         "darwin": {
           "actions": {
             "move_to": {"success_count": 10, "fail_count": 0},
             "click": {"success_count": 8, "fail_count": 2}
           },
           "command_patterns": {
             "move mouse to (x, y)": {"success_count": 5, "fail_count": 0}
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Future Improvements:**
   - Consider using embeddings and vector databases for more advanced learning.
   - Extend the learning mechanism to handle other capabilities (e.g., keyboard input, screen reading).
   - Enhance the suggestion mechanism to provide more context-aware recommendations.
