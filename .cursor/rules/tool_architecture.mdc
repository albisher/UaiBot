# Labeeb Tool Architecture (MDC)

This document outlines the architecture and design principles for Labeeb's tool system.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomicity**
   - Each tool should do one thing well
   - Tools should be composable to build complex capabilities
   - Tools should be independent and self-contained

2. **Discoverability**
   - Tools must be well-documented
   - Tools should be easily discoverable by Labeeb
   - Tools should have clear input/output specifications

3. **Reliability**
   - Tools must handle errors gracefully
   - Tools should provide meaningful error messages
   - Tools should be thoroughly tested
