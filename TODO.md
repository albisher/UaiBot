# UaiBot Future Improvements

## AI-Driven Command Processing

### Short-term Improvements
- [x] Implement JSON-based command extraction as the primary method
- [x] Make command extractor language-agnostic (including Arabic support)
- [x] Fix attribute error in main.py for file processing
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for AI-driven command extraction
- [x] Implement and fix Arabic command extraction in a language-agnostic way
- [ ] Create additional JSON format examples in the documentation
- [ ] Improve error handling and provide more descriptive error messages

### Medium-term Goals
- [ ] Implement adaptive prompting based on user interaction history
- [ ] Add support for complex multi-step operations with state preservation
- [ ] Create a progressive command execution mode that asks for confirmation between steps
- [ ] Implement feedback loop to improve AI response formatting based on success/failure
- [ ] Add template generation for common command patterns

### Long-term Vision
- [ ] Implement fully context-aware command processing
- [ ] Create an AI training pipeline specific to command extraction
- [ ] Develop a command reconciliation system to handle ambiguous requests
- [ ] Build an extensible plugin system for domain-specific command processing
- [ ] Implement cross-session memory for recurring user tasks

## Code Refactoring

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Remove all remaining pattern-matching code that's redundant with AI-driven approach
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate arg parsing code in main.py
- [ ] Clean up error handling throughout the codebase
- [ ] Ensure consistent logging approach across components
- [ ] Fix interdependencies between modules for better separation of concerns

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor the CommandProcessor class to be more modular
- [ ] Split AIHandler into smaller, specialized classes
- [ ] Improve type annotations throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods
- [ ] Implement cleaner configuration management

## Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize JSON parsing in command extractor
- [ ] Add caching for common AI responses
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for command extraction when appropriate 
- [ ] Profile code and identify bottlenecks in main processing loop
- [ ] Reduce memory usage for large command sequences

## Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add integration tests for command processing pipeline
- [ ] Create mock AI responses for testing different scenarios
- [ ] Add benchmarking tests for performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement testing for multilingual support
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline
