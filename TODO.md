# UaiBot Future Improvements

## Platform Support

### Completed
- [x] Complete the platform_manager.py implementation
- [x] Implement proper platform detection and initialization
- [x] Create basic GUI launcher with platform support
- [x] Ensure compatibility with different platforms (Mac, Ubuntu, Jetson)
- [x] Add test script for platform support verification

### Short-term Tasks
- [ ] Create platform-specific implementations for all supported platforms
- [ ] Implement simulation mode for all platform-specific handlers
- [ ] Add platform-specific optimizations for Apple Silicon
- [ ] Enhance GUI components to adapt to platform capabilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all platform-specific code

### Medium-term Goals
- [ ] Create Docker containers for cross-platform testing
- [ ] Implement auto-detection of hardware capabilities
- [ ] Add platform-specific installation scripts
- [ ] Create platform feature parity matrix and documentation

## AI-Driven Command Processing

### Short-term Improvements
- [x] Implement JSON-based command extraction as the primary method
- [x] Make command extractor language-agnostic (including Arabic support)
- [x] Fix attribute error in main.py for file processing
- [x] Add comprehensive unit tests for AI-driven command extraction
- [x] Implement and fix Arabic command extraction in a language-agnostic way
- [ ] Create additional JSON format examples in the documentation
- [ ] Improve error handling and provide more descriptive error messages

### Medium-term Goals
- [ ] Implement adaptive prompting based on user interaction history
- [ ] Add support for complex multi-step operations with state preservation
- [ ] Create a progressive command execution mode that asks for confirmation between steps
- [ ] Implement feedback loop to improve AI response formatting based on success/failure
- [ ] Add template generation for common command patterns

### Long-term Vision
- [ ] Implement fully context-aware command processing
- [ ] Create an AI training pipeline specific to command extraction
- [ ] Develop a command reconciliation system to handle ambiguous requests
- [ ] Build an extensible plugin system for domain-specific command processing
- [ ] Implement cross-session memory for recurring user tasks

## Code Refactoring

### Priority Tasks
- [ ] Remove all remaining pattern-matching code that's redundant with AI-driven approach
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate arg parsing code in main.py
- [ ] Clean up error handling throughout the codebase
- [ ] Ensure consistent logging approach across components
- [ ] Fix interdependencies between modules for better separation of concerns

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor the CommandProcessor class to be more modular
- [ ] Split AIHandler into smaller, specialized classes
- [ ] Improve type annotations throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public methods
- [ ] Implement cleaner configuration management

## Test Organization
- [ ] Ensure all test files are located in the `test_files/` directory
- [ ] Verify all test files are testing new code implementations
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect test file locations

## Performance Improvements
- [ ] Optimize JSON parsing in command extractor
- [ ] Add caching for common AI responses
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for command extraction when appropriate 
- [ ] Profile code and identify bottlenecks in main processing loop
- [ ] Reduce memory usage for large command sequences

## Testing Improvements
- [ ] Add integration tests for command processing pipeline
- [ ] Create mock AI responses for testing different scenarios
- [ ] Add benchmarking tests for performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement testing for multilingual support
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline

## Output Formatting & Integration [HIGH PRIORITY]
- [x] Fix ImportError in main.py and command_processor/__init__.py (blocks all integration and output validation)
- [x] Fix AIHandler initialization error (Unsupported model type)
- [x] Integrate output formatter into main.py for all outputs
- [ ] Refactor command_processor and all modules to use the output handler/facade for all output, enforcing the new output flow (see output_fixes.txt)
- [ ] Ensure AI explanations are only shown if user asks for it or no direct command is possible
- [ ] Revalidate output formatting in all modules and integration tests
- [x] Add configuration option for output verbosity
- [ ] Create a proper output facade pattern to centralize all output handling
- [ ] Add/expand unit and integration tests for output formatting (success, error, info, thinking, command execution)
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new output philosophy and flow
