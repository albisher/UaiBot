make it all work, check if it is working as intended following A2A, MCP, SmolAgents.

you should code all todo .. you should check if it is codded correctly! also you chould test its logic. 

you should find and  solve 
issues, warnings, problems, and bugs right away. 
especially if they are blocking the progress or found in terminal problems.

follow the /UaiBot/.cursor/rules  and updating the /UaiBot/todo files and /UaiBot/README.md as you go. Test the results to confirm files created are worrking and functional.

you are developping proffitionally, you are developping for multi language and multi system

update docs and todos with requirements for each install you need to do

check the systema nd os we are working on now, all os related  changes on the solution should be kept isolated from affecting other os functionality.

our project is now named Labeeb it is no more uai uaibot uaiagent .. so correct naming when found.

looks good please continue the original sequence we are working on from older replies it was:
1- Audit Script Output: What Needs Fixing, a, b, c, d
2- A2A, MCP, SmolAgents Compliance
3- Multi-Language & Multi-System
4. Testing and Validation
5. Documentation and TODOs
6. OS Detection and Isolation - auto detect os developping on.

keep the numbering consistent so I know which one you are reporting back about
