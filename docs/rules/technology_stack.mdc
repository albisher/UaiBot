# Labeeb Technology Stack (MDC)

## Core Principles
- **Minimalism:** Only use libraries that are essential, robust, and cross-platform.
- **Cross-Platform:** All dependencies must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows (unless platform-specific).
- **Replaceability:** If a better, more minimal library exists, prefer it and remove redundant ones.
- **Professionalism:** All choices are justified and documented.

## Core Libraries

## Not Used / Removed
- grpcio, pymilvus: Not needed for native tools, removed for minimalism.
- tkinter: Not used (PyQt5 is preferred for modern GUI).

## Recommendations
- **Always prefer the minimal, most robust, and cross-platform library.**
- **If a library is only needed for a specific platform, guard its import and usage.**
- **If a better library emerges, update this file and remove the old one.**
- **Test all features on all supported platforms.**

## Why These Choices?
- All libraries above are either de facto standards or best-in-class for their purpose.
- All are actively maintained and widely used in the Python ecosystem.
- All are compatible with Python 3.10+ and support macOS, Linux, and Windows (unless noted).
