# System Information Function - Complete Documentation

## Overview
The enhanced `get_system_info()` function in Labeeb's `ai_handler.py` provides comprehensive system information detection across a wide range of operating systems, virtualization environments, and edge cases. This function is used to give the AI context about the user's environment, enabling more accurate and relevant responses.

## Supported Operating Systems

### Primary Systems
1. **macOS (darwin)**
   - Detects version from 10.13 (High Sierra) through 16+ (future versions)
   - Identifies Mac model (e.g., MacBookPro16,1)
   - Shows version name and number (e.g., "Sonoma (14.0)")
   - Detects the user's shell

2. **Windows**
   - Detects Windows edition using multiple methods (wmic, PowerShell)
   - Identifies Windows version
   - Detects shell environment (cmd, PowerShell)
   - Handles cases where standard environment variables aren't available

3. **Linux**
   - Detects distribution name from multiple sources:
     - /etc/os-release (primary)
     - /etc/lsb-release (fallback)
     - lsb_release command (additional fallback)
   - Identifies specialized hardware:
     - Raspberry Pi detection
     - Jetson device detection
   - Detects virtualization environments:
     - Docker containers
     - LXC containers
     - Podman containers
   - Detects Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
   - Identifies Chrome OS (which appears as Linux)
   - Detects Android via Termux
   - Identifies VM environments (VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, etc.)
   - Detects cloud environments (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

4. **BSD Systems**
   - FreeBSD
   - OpenBSD
   - NetBSD

5. **Unix Systems**
   - Solaris/SunOS
   - IBM AIX

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling with nested try/except blocks
- Fallback mechanisms when specific parts of detection fail
- Complete system-level fallback if platform detection fails entirely
- Graceful handling of unusual or unsupported systems

## Output Format
The function returns a string with consistent formatting across all platforms:

- **macOS**: `macOS Sequoia (15.4.1) on Mac16,11 with zsh shell`
- **Windows**: `Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19041) with powershell shell`
- **Linux**: `Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (x86_64) with bash shell`
- **Linux with special hardware**: `Raspberry Pi OS (aarch64) on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.2 with bash shell`
- **Linux with virtualization**: `Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (x86_64) with bash shell in Docker container`
- **Linux on WSL**: `Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (x86_64) with bash shell in Windows Subsystem for Linux`
- **FreeBSD**: `FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE (amd64) with csh shell`
- **Solaris**: `Solaris/SunOS 5.11 (sun4) with bash shell`
- **Unknown systems**: `Unknown-like-0.0 (unknown) with bash shell`

## Testing
The function has been tested extensively with:
1. Actual system testing on macOS
2. Simulation testing for various operating systems
3. Edge case testing for error conditions
4. Targeted testing for specialized environments (WSL, containers, VMs)

## Best Practices
- The function avoids making system calls that could be slow or resource-intensive
- All external calls have proper error handling
- Sensible defaults are used when information can't be detected
- OS-specific code is isolated into clearly defined sections
- Future-proofing for newer OS versions has been implemented
- Shell detection is robust across different operating systems

## Security Considerations
- The function doesn't collect or return any personally identifiable information
- No networking calls are made as part of the detection
- No writes to the filesystem occur during detection
- The function can be audited for any security concerns

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
1. More detailed GPU information for specialized systems
2. Additional cloud platform detection
3. Deeper container orchestration detection (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
4. More specialized device support (embedded systems)
