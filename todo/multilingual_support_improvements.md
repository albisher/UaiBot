# Multilingual Support Improvements

## Current Issues
- ✅ Fixed syntax error in `ai_command_extractor.py` where Arabic keyword "في" was used instead of Python "in"
- Arabic file operations now work correctly for basic commands: create, read, write, delete
- Need more comprehensive Arabic command patterns for search and list operations

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive Arabic command patterns for all file operations
- [ ] Implement better text segmentation for Arabic commands
- [ ] Add support for right-to-left (RTL) formatting in terminal output

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create a dedicated multilingual module that centralizes all language-specific patterns
- [ ] Implement language detection to automatically handle multilingual requests
- [ ] Support file operations with mixed Arabic and English commands

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for other languages (Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.)
- [ ] Create language-specific test suites for all supported languages
- [ ] Implement localized error messages and responses

## Implementation Plan
1. Create a structured language pattern dictionary for each supported language
2. Refactor command extraction to use the language pattern dictionary
3. Add language-specific response formatting
4. Create comprehensive test suite for multilingual support

## Notes on Arabic Language Support
Arabic language presents unique challenges due to:
- Right-to-left text direction
- Different character encoding
- Contextual shaping of letters
- Different sentence structure than English

These challenges need to be addressed in the command extractors and response formatters.
