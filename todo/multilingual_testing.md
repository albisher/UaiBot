# Multilingual Testing Improvements

## High Priority

- [x] Fix syntax errors in Arabic command patterns
- [x] Improve Arabic command extraction to handle more varieties of phrases
- [x] Create a mapping system between Arabic commands and their shell equivalents
- [ ] Implement automatic test recovery if files are left over from failed tests
- [ ] Add support for testing with multiple AI models within the same provider
- [ ] Create visual comparison charts for language performance across providers

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Add support for additional languages (French, Spanish, Chinese)
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests that combine multiple commands in sequence
- [ ] Implement fuzzing tests with slight variations in language patterns
- [ ] Add regression testing to compare against previous test runs
- [ ] Create a continuous integration workflow for multilingual testing

## Low Priority

- [ ] Build interactive web dashboard for test results
- [ ] Create benchmark suite to measure response times across languages
- [ ] Add voice input simulation for testing speech-to-command functionality
- [ ] Implement dialect variation testing within Arabic language
- [ ] Create language proficiency scoring system for different AI providers
- [ ] Add automatic response language detection to respond in the same language as the query

## Technical Debt

- [x] Fix conditional syntax using Arabic words as operators (replace "في" with "in")
- [ ] Refactor validation logic to reduce duplication between test scripts
- [ ] Create common test data generator for consistent test cases
- [ ] Improve error reporting with more detailed failure analysis
- [ ] Extract test case definitions to separate config files for easier maintenance
- [ ] Implement proper test cleanup to ensure clean state between runs

## Documentation Needed

- [ ] Create comprehensive guide for adding new language support
- [ ] Document best practices for writing test commands in different languages
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common multilingual issues
- [ ] Add examples of expected outputs for each test case
- [ ] Document performance considerations for different languages
- [ ] Create reference for Arabic command patterns and their English/shell equivalents
