# TODOs for GUI Terminal/Text Area

- Refactor GUI text area to behave as a terminal emulator for command output.
- Display all command results, system feedback, and errors in the GUI, not just the terminal.
- Show model switching prompts and confirmations in the GUI.
- Format output for clarity: use sections, colors, or icons for success, error, info, and command output.
- Ensure text commands entered in the GUI show their results in the GUI output area.
- Route all backend/system feedback (including errors and confirmations) to the GUI display.
- Support scrollback and copy/paste in the GUI terminal area.
- Optionally, allow clearing or saving the terminal output from the GUI.
