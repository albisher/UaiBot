# Multilingual Improvements

## Bugs Fixed
- Fixed syntax error in `test_multilingual.py` where Arabic word "في" (fee/in) was mistakenly used instead of Python keyword "in"

## Suggested Improvements
- Add automated syntax checks for multilingual code to prevent mixing Arabic words with Python keywords
- Create helper functions to handle Arabic language commands more reliably
- Implement more comprehensive Arabic language test cases
- Consider adding language detection to automatically handle different input languages
- Add documentation explaining how to handle non-English characters in code comments vs string literals

## Next Steps
1. Review all multilingual code for similar syntax issues
2. Implement a pre-commit hook to check for language mixing issues
3. Expand test coverage for Arabic commands
4. Consider creating a specialized multilingual command parser
