# UaiBot Output Formatting Issues and Fixes

## Output Philosophy & Flow (NEW)
- Show 'thinking' only if no direct command is found or user asks for explanation.
- Always execute the command to be executed (in a clear line/box).
- Always show the result of the command (in a result box/section).
- Only show AI explanation if user asks for it or no direct command is possible.
- Never show duplicate outputs of any type.
- All modules must use the output handler/facade to enforce this.


## Fixed Items
- Created dedicated output formatter module
- Patched main script to prevent duplicate outputs [REVALIDATED after fixing import errors]
- Added single-output printer to ensure each message is shown once
- Fixed log duplication with a custom filter
- Fixed ImportError and AIHandler config issues in main.py
- Integrated output formatter into main.py for all outputs

## To Do
- Revalidate output formatting in all modules and integration tests
- Consider adding color formatting for better readability
