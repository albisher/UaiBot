# File Operations Improvements

## Current Issues
- Fixed IndentationError in main.py by implementing a proper file operations handler
- The error occurred because the `elif operation == 'read':` statement wasn't properly indented after an `else` block
- Need to improve robustness of file path handling, especially with relative paths

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for file operations functions
- [ ] Implement safety checks to prevent accidental file overwrites
- [ ] Add support for recursive directory operations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create a more sophisticated file path resolver that handles:
  - Relative paths
  - Home directory expansion (~)
  - Environment variable substitution
- [ ] Implement batch file operations
- [ ] Add support for file metadata operations (permissions, timestamps)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for more complex file operations:
  - File comparison
  - Finding duplicate files
  - Advanced search options (by date, size, content)
- [ ] Create a web UI for file operations

## Implementation Plan
1. Refactor file operations into a dedicated module with proper OOP design
2. Create a comprehensive test suite for all file operations
3. Add proper documentation and examples for each operation
4. Implement enhanced error handling and user feedback
5. Add support for more complex file paths and operations

## Documentation Needs
- Update main README.md with file operations examples
- Create a cheat sheet for common file operations queries
- Document best practices for file path handling
