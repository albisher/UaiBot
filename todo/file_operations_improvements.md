# File Operations Improvements

## Current Issues
- Fixed IndentationError in main.py by implementing a proper file operations handler
- The error occurred because the `elif operation == 'read':` statement wasn't properly indented after an `else` block
- Need to improve robustness of file path handling, especially with relative paths
- âœ… Fixed Arabic language support in file operations (syntax error in ai_command_extractor.py)

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for file operations functions
- [ ] Implement safety checks to prevent accidental file overwrites
- [ ] Add support for recursive directory operations
- [ ] Improve multilingual support for file operations commands

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create a more sophisticated file path resolver that handles:
  - Relative paths
  - Home directory expansion (~)
  - Environment variable substitution
- [ ] Implement batch file operations
- [ ] Add support for file metadata operations (permissions, timestamps)
- [ ] Create separate language handlers for non-Latin script languages

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add support for more complex file operations:
  - File comparison
  - Finding duplicate files
  - Advanced search options (by date, size, content)
- [ ] Create a web UI for file operations
- [ ] Support file operations in multiple languages simultaneously

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix critical bugs in multilingual support
2. Implement comprehensive test suite for file operations
3. Enhance command extraction to better handle different languages
4. Refactor file operations to be more modular and extendable

## Documentation Needs
- Update main README.md with file operations examples
- Create a cheat sheet for common file operations queries
- Document best practices for file path handling
