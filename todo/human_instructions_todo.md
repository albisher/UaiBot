# Human Instructions Todo

## Critical Tasks

### 1. Create Base Structure
- [ ] Create main human_instructions directory if not exists
- [ ] Create subdirectories for different command areas:
  - [ ] file_operations/
  - [ ] system_info/
  - [ ] command_processing/
  - [ ] multilingual/
  - [ ] utils/

### 2. File Operations Instructions
- [ ] Create `file_operations/commands.txt` with:
  - [ ] English command patterns
  - [ ] Arabic command patterns
  - [ ] Command variations
  - [ ] Examples and use cases

### 3. System Information Instructions
- [ ] Create `system_info/commands.txt` with:
  - [ ] System status commands
  - [ ] Resource monitoring commands
  - [ ] Hardware information commands
  - [ ] Network information commands

### 4. Command Processing Instructions
- [ ] Create `command_processing/commands.txt` with:
  - [ ] Basic command patterns
  - [ ] Complex command patterns
  - [ ] Error handling patterns
  - [ ] Context management patterns

### 5. Multilingual Support Instructions
- [ ] Create `multilingual/commands.txt` with:
  - [ ] Language detection patterns
  - [ ] Translation patterns
  - [ ] Bilingual command patterns
  - [ ] Cultural considerations

### 6. Utility Instructions
- [ ] Create `utils/commands.txt` with:
  - [ ] Helper function patterns
  - [ ] Common utility patterns
  - [ ] Debug patterns
  - [ ] Testing patterns

## Implementation Details

### File Format
Each instruction file should follow this structure:
```markdown
# [Area] Commands

## English Commands
- Pattern 1
- Pattern 2
- Pattern 3

## Arabic Commands
- Pattern 1
- Pattern 2
- Pattern 3

## Examples
1. Example 1
2. Example 2
3. Example 3

## Notes
- Important consideration 1
- Important consideration 2
```

### Priority Order
1. File Operations (highest priority)
2. System Information
3. Command Processing
4. Multilingual Support
5. Utilities

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Create test cases for each instruction set
- [ ] Verify command pattern coverage
- [ ] Test multilingual support
- [ ] Validate examples

## Dependencies
- [ ] Update requirements.txt if needed
- [ ] Ensure all necessary language models are available
- [ ] Verify file system permissions

## Documentation
- [ ] Create README for human_instructions directory
- [ ] Document file format standards
- [ ] Add contribution guidelines
- [ ] Include examples of good patterns

## Review Process
- [ ] Peer review of instruction sets
- [ ] Native speaker review for Arabic patterns
- [ ] Technical review for accuracy
- [ ] User testing for clarity
