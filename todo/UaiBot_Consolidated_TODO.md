## Future Enhancements

### Performance
- [ ] Implement caching for model responses
- [ ] Add parallel execution for multi-step plans
- [ ] Optimize plugin loading and initialization
- [ ] Add model response streaming

### Security
- [ ] Add plugin sandboxing
- [ ] Implement permissions system
- [ ] Add model access control
- [ ] Secure configuration storage

### Features
- [ ] Add more plugins (system info, file operations, etc.)
- [ ] Create plugin marketplace
- [ ] Add model fine-tuning support
- [ ] Implement conversation history
- [ ] Add export/import functionality for settings

### Integration
- [ ] Add support for more model providers
- [ ] Implement WebSocket API for external tools
- [ ] Add REST API for remote control
- [ ] Create mobile app interface

## Known Issues
- [ ] Memory leaks in long-running sessions
- [ ] Connection drops with Ollama API
- [ ] Error handling in plugin system needs improvement
- [ ] GUI responsiveness during model loading
- [ ] Model switching can be slow with large models

## Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Create plugin development guide
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide

## New Tasks

### SystemAwareness
- [x] Refactor SystemAwarenessManager as SystemAwarenessTool and register with agent
- [x] Refactor UserRoutineAwarenessManager as UserRoutineAwarenessTool and register with agent
- [x] Refactor Device/USB/Screen/Audio handlers as DeviceAwarenessTool and register with agent
- [ ] Test CLI/GUI with new tools/agents
- [ ] Update documentation for each new tool/agent
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and cross-platform notes to README

## Cross-Platform & Troubleshooting Notes
- All tools/agents must handle platform-specific features gracefully
- If a feature is unavailable, return a clear error message
- Document any platform-specific limitations in the README
- Ensure proper error handling for missing dependencies (PyAudio, Quartz, WMI)
- Test device detection on all supported platforms
