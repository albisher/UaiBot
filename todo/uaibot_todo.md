# UaiBot Project Todo

## Completed
- Implemented `MemoryHandler` class to manage UaiBot's state and memory.
- Updated `CommandProcessor` to handle sequential actions and utilize the new handlers.
- Fixed the call to `update_browser_state` in `CommandProcessor` to pass both browser and state arguments.
- Installed required dependencies in a virtual environment.

## Pending
- Test the sequential command functionality with the updated `CommandProcessor`.
- Implement additional features for browser interaction, such as clicking links and focusing the browser.
- Enhance error handling and logging throughout the application.
- Update documentation to reflect recent changes and new features.
- Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features to ensure stability and reliability.
- Update the `BrowserHandler` to include a 'browser_state' key in the result dictionary, even if it's an empty dictionary or a default state.
- Update the `BrowserInteractionHandler` to handle the 'default' browser case, similar to the `BrowserHandler`.
- Enhance the `click_middle_link` method to take a screenshot of the page and visually determine the middle link based on the screenshot.
- Add additional logging in the `CommandProcessor` to capture the exact result returned by the browser handlers.
