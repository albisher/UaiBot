First and most important is to follow main_prompt.txt precisly to remember who you are and how we deal with things.

Then, start thinking, does all test py files do the correct new code related tests? are all tests located in the correct folder? is the destination folder clearly named as test_files ?

once you come up with a plan, prepare all in related files (logs, todo, tests, checks, documentations updates and corrections), and start executing the needed changes on the code. Apply final tests if needed, observe confimations, finalize.
