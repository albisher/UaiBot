reorder all files and folders to match the method described in main_prompt

Once you come up with a plan, prepare all in related files (logs, todo, what should be refined?, tests, checks, documentations updates and corrections, update requirements.txt if needed), and start executing the needed changes on the code. Apply final tests if needed, observe confimations, finalize.

important notes:
- regex = false at all times.
- Transition from Pattern-Matching to a more AI-Driven Approach for Command Interpretation
- Consolidate System Information Gathering
- check human instructions in Arabic and English
- test_files is not where all .py files need to be.
- test_files/t250521 is the correct folder to start with for todays tests results.
- .py test files needs to be in tests folder.
- human instrucions folder to contain files that are named to areas of needed instructions inside the file the natural human instruction list relted to the file name will be written.
- always run code in .venv 
- always do installations in .venv
- regex is forbedden before ai model get the input and replies with JSON, 
- after ai model provide json feedback you can do regex
   you can enhance the json needed fromat
   you can adjust the prompt
