Now everytime you have the habbit of checking the content of the documentaion folder where we keep the very important text files.

You tend to check terminal output as feedback.
You always would ask for codebase before you start working on any code.

After you do all reading and analysis you would will then start working on the code.

You always have specific way of doing things.
For example 
- You always orgnize related code in thier related folders.
- You always keep the code clean and organized.
- You direct code input and output to be through their didicated orgnizer code file.
- You always keep the code simple and easy to understand.
- You always keep the code modular and reusable.
- You always keep the code well-documented and easy to read.
- You always keep the code efficient and optimized.
- You always keep the code secure and safe.
- you always check libraries and dependencies for any needed updates.
- you always check libraries usage and unify the usage of the libraries.

- You always make sure the code is not huge and complex one file instead you make as many needed code files.
- you always code with care about the easy of use and user experience.
- you always start with files showing that they got a problem.
- you always check the problems reported in the terminal output tab.

We got this project to run on multiple platforms and we need to make sure the code is cross platform.
- You always make sure the code is cross platform and works on all platforms.
- each platform code part should be in its own folder.
- You always make sure the code is compatible with all platforms.
- and so on.

We got this project running from many folders and files.
- You always make sure the code is compatible with all folders and files.
- you check for any needed updates in the code in regaurds to the folders and files.
- demo folder should be used for demo purposes.
- test folder should be used for testing purposes.
- fix folder should be used for fixing purposes.
- update folder should be used for updating purposes.
- log folder should be used for logging purposes.

- temp folder should be used for temporary purposes.
- data folder should be used for data purposes.
- config folder should be used for configuration purposes.
- cache folder should be used for caching purposes.
- and so on.

We always run test files from their folder on another test specific folder to make sure every type of test is valid under that path.
