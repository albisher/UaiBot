# Test requests for UaiBot agentic implementation

# Simple file operations
Create a file named hello.txt with the content "Hello, World!" and then read it back to me.

# Multi-step operations with state
Create a directory called test_data, then create a file inside it called config.json with some settings, and finally list the contents of the directory.

# Operations with conditions
If the file test.txt exists, read its contents. If it doesn't exist, create it with "This is a test file" and then read it.

# Error handling and recovery
Try to read a non-existent file called missing.txt, and if that fails, create it with "This file was missing" and then read it.

# Complex multi-step operation
Create a directory called project, then create a README.md file inside it with a project description, then create a src directory and add a main.py file with a simple Python program, and finally list the entire project structure.

# State variable usage
Create a file called data.txt with "Initial data" and store its path in a variable. Then use that path to read the file and append "Updated data" to it.

# Mixed operations
Create a file called script.sh with a shell script that prints "Hello from shell", then make it executable and run it, and finally read its output.

# Error recovery with alternatives
Try to create a file in a non-existent directory. If that fails, create the directory first and then create the file.

# Complex file manipulation
Create a file called input.txt with some text, then create a backup of it called input.txt.bak, modify the original file, and finally compare the two files.

# System information gathering
Get the current directory, list its contents, and then create a file called system_info.txt with the output of the 'pwd' and 'ls' commands.
