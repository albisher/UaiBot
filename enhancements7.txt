# UaiBot Accessibility Enhancement: Assistive Technology Features

## Overview and Purpose

This document outlines the implementation plan for transforming UaiBot into a comprehensive assistive technology solution for users with mobility impairments, motor difficulties, and other accessibility needs. By enabling UaiBot to control mouse movements, simulate keyboard inputs, and accept multimodal commands with first-class Arabic language support, the application can serve as a powerful accessibility tool for a broader range of users.

## 1. Mouse Control Capabilities

### 1.1 Core Mouse Control Functions

The system must implement the following core mouse control functions, with consistently formatted Arabic language support for all commands:

| Function | English Command | Arabic Command | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Move cursor | "move mouse to X,Y" | "حرك المؤشر إلى X,Y" | `move_mouse(x, y)` |
| Relative movement | "move mouse right 50 pixels" | "حرك المؤشر يمين 50 بيكسل" | `move_mouse_relative(dx, dy)` |
| Left click | "click" or "left click" | "اضغط" أو "اضغط يسار" | `mouse_click(button="left")` |
| Right click | "right click" | "اضغط يمين" | `mouse_click(button="right")` |
| Middle click | "middle click" | "اضغط وسط" | `mouse_click(button="middle")` |
| Double click | "double click" | "اضغط مرتين" | `mouse_double_click()` |
| Click and drag | "drag from X,Y to Z,W" | "اسحب من X,Y إلى Z,W" | `mouse_drag(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)` |
| Scroll | "scroll up/down N lines" | "مرر لأعلى/لأسفل N سطر" | `mouse_scroll(direction, lines)` |

### 1.2 Advanced Mouse Control Features

- **Screen Region Awareness**: 
  - "Click on the save button" (اضغط على زر الحفظ)
  - "Click the search box" (اضغط على مربع البحث)
  - Implementation should use computer vision to identify UI elements

- **Object Tracking**:
  - "Follow the moving target" (تتبع الهدف المتحرك)
  - "Click when the button turns green" (اضغط عندما يتحول الزر إلى اللون الأخضر)
  - Uses real-time image processing to track dynamic elements

- **Gesture Emulation**:
  - "Perform a pinch gesture" (قم بحركة القرص)
  - "Draw a circle" (ارسم دائرة)
  - Complex gesture simulation for touch-enabled devices

## 2. Keyboard Simulation

### 2.1 Core Keyboard Functions

| Function | English Command | Arabic Command | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Type text | "type: [text]" | "اكتب: [نص]" | `keyboard_type(text)` |
| Press key | "press Enter" | "اضغط Enter" | `keyboard_press(key)` |
| Hold key | "hold Shift" | "امسك Shift" | `keyboard_hold(key)` |
| Release key | "release Shift" | "حرر Shift" | `keyboard_release(key)` |
| Key combination | "press Ctrl+C" | "اضغط Ctrl+C" | `keyboard_hotkey([keys])` |

### 2.2 Advanced Keyboard Features

- **Predictive Text**: Provide intelligent suggestions for faster typing
- **Custom Shortcut Support**: Allow users to define custom shortcuts for common actions
- **Application-Specific Commands**: Optimize keyboard simulations for popular applications

### 2.3 Multilingual Input Support

- **Arabic Typing Optimization**:
  - Intelligent handling of right-to-left text directionality
  - Proper context-sensitive character forms (initial, medial, final, isolated)
  - Auto-correction specific to Arabic typing patterns
  - Support for Arabic diacritics

- **Bilingual Commands**:
  - Seamless switching between Arabic and English command processing
  - Hybrid command recognition (e.g., "اضغط على Enter" mixing Arabic instructions with English key names)

## 3. Multimodal Input Methods

### 3.1 Voice Command Input

- **Continuous Listening Mode**: Always ready to accept voice commands
- **Wake Word Support**: Activation by custom wake word in Arabic or English
- **Dialectal Varieties**: Support for multiple Arabic dialects beyond Modern Standard Arabic
- **Noise Resilience**: Effective operation in noisy environments

### 3.2 Webcam-Based Gesture Recognition

- **Head Tracking**: Control cursor with head movements
  - English: "Track my head movement"
  - Arabic: "تتبع حركة رأسي"

- **Eye Gaze Tracking**: Select items by looking at them
  - English: "Enable eye control" 
  - Arabic: "فعّل التحكم بالعين"

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Control interface with hand gestures
  - Pointing for cursor movement
  - Hand poses for different clicks
  - Custom gestures for common actions

- **Facial Expression Recognition**: Use expressions as commands
  - Smile, wink, eyebrow movements mapped to specific actions
  - Customizable expression mapping

## 4. Arabic Language Integration

### 4.1 Arabic as First-Class Citizen

- **Complete Command Parity**: Every English command must have an Arabic equivalent
- **Natural Language Processing**: Optimize for Arabic grammar and sentence structure
- **Custom Vocabulary**: Domain-specific terminology in Arabic
- **Documentation**: Full user documentation in Arabic

### 4.2 Arabic UI Considerations

- **Right-to-Left Interface**: Proper RTL design for all UI elements
- **Typography**: Optimized Arabic font selection for readability
- **Cultural Appropriateness**: Culturally appropriate icons and visual metaphors
