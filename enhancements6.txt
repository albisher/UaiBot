# UaiBot Log Formatting Guidelines

## Visual Distinction for Logs

To improve user experience and clearly distinguish between log messages and actual command output, the following guidelines should be implemented:

### 1. Log Message Formatting
- **Color**: All log messages should be displayed in mid-gray color (#888888) to visually separate them from normal output
- **Prefix**: Each log message should start with a log emoji (📋) for immediate visual identification
- **Format**: `📋 [LOG] Your log message here`

### 2. Log Types and Their Visual Indicators
- **Debug logs**: 🔍 Gray color (#888888) - Only shown when debug mode is activated
- **Info logs**: 📋 Gray color (#888888) - Standard logging level
- **Warning logs**: ⚠️ Light amber text - For potential issues
- **Error logs**: 🚫 Should remain light fire text and visible (not gray) but clearly marked as errors

### 3. Implementation Details
- Use terminal color codes for console output (e.g., `\033[90m` for gray text)
- For GUI interfaces, use appropriate styling methods of the UI framework
- Set up a consistent logging utility function that handles these styles automatically
- All debugging details should be hidden from users unless explicitly requested

### 4. User-facing vs. Developer-facing Logs
- User-facing messages should be concise, helpful, and free of technical jargon
- Developer-focused logs should only appear in debug mode or in log files
- Verbose technical output should be redirected to log files rather than terminal

This standardized approach ensures that users can easily distinguish between system logs and actual command outputs, creating a cleaner, more professional user experience.
