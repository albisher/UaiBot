# UaiBot Output Formatting Issues and Fixes

## Output Philosophy & Flow (NEW)
- Show 'thinking' only if no direct command is found or user asks for explanation.
- Always execute the command to be executed (in a clear line/box).
- Always show the result of the command (in a result box/section).
- Only show AI explanation if user asks for it or no direct command is possible.
- Never show duplicate outputs of any type.
- All modules must use the output handler/facade to enforce this.

## Issues Identified
- Output is shown multiple times (3x duplication) [RESOLVED]
- Some outputs don't follow the consistent format [RESOLVED]
- Logger is outputting the same information multiple times [RESOLVED]
- Thinking box is shown multiple times [RESOLVED]
- main.py and integration tests fail due to ImportError: cannot import name 'ShellHandler' from 'command_processor' [RESOLVED]
- AIHandler initialization error (Unsupported model type) [RESOLVED]

## Fixed Items
- Created dedicated output formatter module
- Patched main script to prevent duplicate outputs [REVALIDATED after fixing import errors]
- Added single-output printer to ensure each message is shown once
- Fixed log duplication with a custom filter
- Fixed ImportError and AIHandler config issues in main.py
- Integrated output formatter into main.py for all outputs

## To Do
- Refactor command_processor and all modules to use the output handler/facade for all output
- Enforce the new output flow in all modules and tests
- Revalidate output formatting in all modules and integration tests
- Add configuration option for output verbosity [DONE]
- Create a proper output facade pattern to centralize all output handling
- Add unit tests for output formatting
- Consider adding color formatting for better readability
