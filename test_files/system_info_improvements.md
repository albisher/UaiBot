# System Information Function Improvements - Summary

## Testing Results and Changes Made

### Initial Tests
- Verified that the `get_system_info()` function in `ai_handler.py` returns accurate information for the current system (macOS)
- Created a simulation test approach to validate handling of different operating systems

### Issues Identified
1. **macOS:** The version mapping only went up to macOS 15 (Sequoia) without future-proofing
2. **Windows:** Only had one method for getting the system version (wmic) which might not work on all Windows installations
3. **Windows:** Shell detection could be improved to properly handle PowerShell and cmd
4. **Linux:** Limited handling for systems without /etc/os-release
5. **BSD:** No dedicated handling for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and other BSD variants
6. **Containers:** No detection for containers/VMs which can be important information
7. **Error Handling:** Some try/except blocks could be more specific to prevent hidden errors

### Improvements Implemented
1. **Enhanced macOS support:**
   - Added future-proofing for macOS versions beyond Sequoia
   - Improved the fallback version naming when unknown versions are encountered

2. **Enhanced Windows support:**
   - Added multiple methods for detecting Windows edition (wmic, PowerShell)
   - Improved shell detection to better handle cmd, PowerShell, and other shells
   - Better handling of environment variables on Windows

3. **Enhanced Linux support:**
   - Added support for alternative distribution information sources:
     - /etc/os-release (primary method)
     - /etc/lsb-release (secondary method)
     - lsb_release command (tertiary method)
   - Added detection for container environments (Docker, LXC, Podman)
   - Enhanced error handling during system detection

4. **Added BSD support:**
   - Added explicit handling for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD systems
   - Proper formatting for BSD system information

5. **Improved error handling:**
   - Added nested try/except blocks to handle specific error cases
   - Ensured function continues even if parts of the detection fail
   - Better fallbacks for all error conditions

6. **Testing:**
   - Created multiple test scripts to verify function behavior:
     - Direct tests on current system
     - Simulation tests for different OS types

### Verification
The updated `get_system_info()` function successfully returns system information for:
- macOS (tested on actual system)
- Windows (simulated testing)
- Various Linux distributions (simulated testing)
- BSD systems (simulated testing)
- Unusual or unsupported systems (simulated testing)

### Conclusion
The `get_system_info()` function now has comprehensive support for all major operating systems and should handle edge cases more gracefully. The function is now more robust, future-proof, and provides more detailed system information for each platform.
