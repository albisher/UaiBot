CTI

Cyber Threat Intelligence repository
of the ATT&CK catalog expressed in STIX 2.0 JSON. This
repository also contains
our USAGE document
which includes additional examples of accessing
and parsing our dataset in Python.
ATT&CK

ATT&CK® is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, reflecting the various
phases of an adversary’s lifecycle, and the platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK is useful
for understanding security risk against known adversary behavior, for planning security
improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected.

STIX

Structured Threat Information Expression
(STIX™) is a language and serialization format used to
exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).
STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine-readable manner,
allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to
see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.
STIX is designed to improve many capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated
threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
