    "raw_ai_response": "{\n  \"command\": \"Okay, let's break down \\\"development health\\\" \\u2013 it's a surprisingly complex term with multiple layers. It's not just about economic growth; it encompasses a broad range of indicators and factors that contribute to a society's overall well-being. Here's a comprehensive look at what it means, how it\\u2019s measured, and key considerations:\\n\\n**1. What is Development Health?**\\n\\nAt its core, \\\"development health\\\" refers to the *overall quality of life* for a population. It's a holistic assessment that goes beyond GDP to understand whether a country is truly progressing in ways that benefit its people. It\\u2019s about creating sustainable and equitable development.\\n\\n**2. Key Dimensions & Indicators:**\\n\\nDevelopment health is typically assessed across several dimensions, each with associated indicators:\\n\\n* **Economic Development:**\\n    * **GDP per capita:**  A basic measure of economic output per person. (However, it\\u2019s a flawed metric on its own - doesn't account for distribution or environmental impact)\\n    * **Income Inequality (Gini coefficient):**  Measures the gap between the richest and poorest in a population.  A lower Gini coefficient indicates more equal distribution.\\n    * **Employment Rates:** Percentage of the population actively working.\\n    * **Industrialization & Diversification:**  The structure of the economy \\u2013 is it reliant on a single commodity or diversified?\\n\\n* **Social Development:**\\n    * **Human Development Index (HDI):** This is *the* most commonly used composite measure. It combines:\\n        * **Life Expectancy:**  Average number of years a person is expected to live.\\n        * **Education Index:** Based on mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.\\n        * **Gross National Income (GNI) per capita:** (A lower income bracket version of GDP per capita used in the HDI calculation)\\n    * **Literacy Rate:** Percentage of the population that can read and write.\\n    * **Access to Healthcare:**  Availability of doctors, hospitals, and preventative care.\\n    * **Child Mortality Rate:** Number of children who die before their fifth birthday. (A key indicator of a nation's health and development)\\n    * **Social Mobility:** The ability of individuals to move up or down the socioeconomic ladder.\\n\\n* **Environmental Sustainability:**\\n    * **Carbon Emissions:**  A measure of greenhouse gas emissions, indicating the impact on climate change.\\n    * **Deforestation Rates:**  The rate at which forests are being cleared.\\n    * **Air and Water Quality:**  Levels of pollution.\\n    * **Renewable Energy Use:**  Percentage of energy derived from renewable sources.\\n    * **Biodiversity Conservation:**  Indicators of protecting and maintaining ecosystems.\\n\\n* **Governance & Institutional Development:**\\n    * **Corruption Perception Index:** Measures perceived levels of public sector corruption.\\n    * **Rule of Law:**  Extent to which laws are enforced and applied fairly.\\n    * **Political Stability:**  Stability of the government and absence of violence.\\n    * **Voice and Accountability:**  Extent to which citizens can participate in decision-making.\\n\\n\\n\\n**3.  Important Considerations & Nuances:**\\n\\n* **Context Matters:**  There\\u2019s no one-size-fits-all definition of \\\"development health.\\\" What constitutes progress in a rural, agrarian society will be very different from a rapidly industrializing one.\\n* **Inequality is Crucial:**  Simply increasing GDP doesn\\u2019t guarantee development health. High levels of inequality can undermine social cohesion and make progress unevenly distributed.\\n* **Sustainability is Key:**  Development must be environmentally sustainable to ensure that future generations can also enjoy prosperity.\\n* **Data Limitations:** Data availability and quality can vary significantly across countries, making comparisons challenging.\\n* **Beyond Numbers:** Development health also involves qualitative factors like social trust, cultural values, and community engagement.\\n\\n**4.  Resources for Further Research:**\\n\\n* **United Nations Development Programme (UNDP):** [https://www.undp.org/](https://www.undp.org/) (Especially the Human Development Report)\\n* **World Bank:** [https://www.worldbank.org/](https://www.worldbank.org/)\\n* **Human Development Report:** [http://hdr.undp.org/](http://hdr.undp.org/) (Published annually)\\n\\n\\n\\n**To help me give you a more targeted response, could you tell me:**\\n\\n*   **What specifically are you interested in regarding \\\"development health\\\"?** (e.g., a particular country, region, sector, or issue?)\\n*   **What is the purpose of your inquiry?** (e.g., research, a project, general knowledge?)\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"model\": \"gemma3:4b\",\n  \"type\": \"shell\",\n  \"parameters\": {}\n}",
