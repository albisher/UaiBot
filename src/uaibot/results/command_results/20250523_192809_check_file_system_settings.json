    "raw_ai_response": "{\n  \"command\": \"Okay, let's check your file system settings.  I can't directly access your computer to do this for you, but I can guide you through the process on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  I'll give you the instructions for each operating system.\\n\\n**1. Windows**\\n\\nThere are several ways to check file system settings in Windows. Here's a breakdown of the most common:\\n\\n* **File Explorer (Quickest Method):**\\n    1. Open File Explorer (Windows key + E).\\n    2. Right-click on your C: drive (or whichever drive you want to check).\\n    3. Select \\\"Properties\\\".\\n    4. The \\\"General\\\" tab will show you information about the drive, including:\\n        * **File system:** (NTFS, FAT32, exFAT) \\u2013 This is the most important setting.\\n        * **Allocation unit size:** This determines how the drive is divided into blocks.  Generally, you don't need to change this unless you're dealing with very large files.\\n        * **Volume label:** The name of the drive.\\n        * **Available space:** How much free space is left.\\n        * **Drive letter:** The assigned letter (e.g., C:).\\n\\n* **Disk Management:** (For more detailed control)\\n    1. Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.\\n    2. Type `diskmgmt.msc` and press Enter.\\n    3. This opens the Disk Management utility.\\n    4. Here you can see all your drives, their partitions, and file system types.\\n    5. You can also:\\n        * Create new partitions.\\n        * Change the file system of a partition (be very careful with this!).\\n        * Shrink or extend partitions.\\n\\n* **Command Prompt (Advanced):**\\n    1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator (search for \\\"cmd\\\", right-click, and select \\\"Run as administrator\\\").\\n    2. Type `fsutil fsinfo volumeinfo` and press Enter.\\n    3. This command displays detailed information about the file system, including the file system type, volume label, and other settings.\\n\\n**Key File System Considerations in Windows:**\\n\\n* **NTFS:** The most common and recommended file system for Windows. It supports large files, security features, and journaling (which helps prevent data loss).\\n* **FAT32:** Older file system. Limited to files smaller than 4GB.  Generally not recommended for modern use.\\n* **exFAT:**  A good alternative to FAT32, especially if you need to store files larger than 4GB and want compatibility with both Windows and macOS.\\n\\n**2. macOS**\\n\\n* **Disk Utility:** (The primary tool)\\n    1. Open Disk Utility (Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility).\\n    2. Select the drive you want to check in the sidebar.\\n    3. The main window displays:\\n        * **File System:** (APFS, HFS+, FAT) \\u2013  APFS is the default for macOS and is generally the best choice.\\n        * **Volume Name:** The name of the volume.\\n        * **Capacity:** The total storage capacity.\\n        * **Used:** The amount of space used.\\n        * **Available:** The amount of free space.\\n\\n* **Terminal (Advanced):**\\n    1. Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal).\\n    2. Type `diskutil list` and press Enter.\\n    3. This command lists all connected disks and their partitions.  You can see the file system type for each partition.\\n    4. To get more detailed information about a specific partition, use `diskutil info [partition identifier]`.  The partition identifier is the number listed in the `diskutil list` output.\\n\\n**Key File System Considerations in macOS:**\\n\\n* **APFS (Apple File System):** The default file system for macOS High Sierra and later. It's optimized for SSDs and offers features like snapshots and cloning.\\n* **HFS+ (Hierarchical File System Plus):** Older file system. Still used for older macOS versions.\\n* **FAT32:**  Like Windows, limited to files smaller than 4GB.\\n\\n**3. Linux**\\n\\n* **`df` Command (Most Common):**\\n    1. Open a terminal.\\n    2. Type `df -h` and press Enter.\\n    3. This command displays disk space usage for all mounted file systems.  The output includes:\\n        * **Filesystem:** The device name (e.g., `/dev/sda1`) and the file system type (e.g., ext4).\\n        * **Size:** The total size of the file system.\\n        * **Used:** The amount of space used.\\n        * **Available:** The amount of free space.\\n        * **Use%:** The percentage of space used.\\n        * **Mounted on:** The mount point (e.g., `/` for the root file system).\\n\\n* **`lsblk` Command (List Block Devices):**\\n    1. Open a terminal.\\n    2. Type `lsblk` and press Enter.\\n    3. This command lists all block devices (disks and partitions) and their file system types.\\n\\n* **`mount` Command (For More Detail):**\\n   1. Open a terminal.\\n   2. Type `mount` and press Enter.\\n   3. This command lists all mounted file systems and their mount points.\\n\\n**Key File System Considerations in Linux:**\\n\\n* **ext4:** The most common file system for Linux. It's reliable and performs well.\\n* **ext3, ext2:** Older versions of the ext file system.\\n* **FAT32:**  Used for compatibility with other operating systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To help me give you more specific guidance, could you tell me:**\\n\\n*   **What operating system are you using?** (Windows, macOS, Linux \\u2013 and if Linux, which distribution?)\\n*   **What are you trying to achieve by checking the file system settings?** (e.g., troubleshoot a problem, understand your storage, prepare a drive for a specific purpose)\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.95,\n  \"model\": \"gemma3:4b\",\n  \"type\": \"shell\",\n  \"parameters\": {}\n}",
