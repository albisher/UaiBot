        "command": "Okay, let's break down keyboard layouts. There isn't *one* keyboard layout \u2013 it depends on the language and region you're using. Here's a breakdown of the most common layouts:\n\n**1. QWERTY (The Most Common)**\n\n*   **Origin:** Developed by Christopher Latham Sholes in the 1870s.\n*   **Purpose (Originally):** Designed to *prevent* typewriters from jamming by separating commonly used letter pairs.\n*   **Used In:** Primarily used in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other countries.\n*   **Visual Representation:**\n\n    ```\n    Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \\\n    A S D F G H J K L ; '\n    Z X C V B N M , . /\n    ```\n\n**2. AZERTY (France, Belgium, and some parts of Switzerland)**\n\n*   **Based on:** A modified QWERTY layout.\n*   **Differences:**  The main difference is the placement of the 'A' and 'Q' keys, and the 'W' and 'Z' keys.  It's designed for French, but is also used in other European countries.\n*   **Visual Representation:**\n\n    ```\n    Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \\\n    A S D F G H J K L ; '\n    Z X C V B N M , . /\n    ```\n\n**3. Dvorak (Designed for Efficiency)**\n\n*   **Developed by:** August Dvorak in 1936.\n*   **Purpose:**  Designed to be more efficient by placing the most frequently used letters on the home row (the row you rest your fingers on).\n*   **Less Common:**  Not as widely used as QWERTY. Requires retraining your muscle memory.\n*   **Visual Representation:**\n\n    ```\n    Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \\\n    A S D F G H J K L ; '\n    Z X C V B N M , . /\n    ```\n\n**4. Colemak (A Modern Alternative)**\n\n*   **Developed by:** Dale Zimmer in 2005.\n*   **Purpose:** A more modern layout that aims for efficiency while being easier to learn than Dvorak.  It's designed to be more similar to QWERTY, making the transition easier.\n*   **Growing in Popularity:**  Becoming increasingly popular among those seeking a more efficient alternative to QWERTY.\n*   **Visual Representation:**\n\n    ```\n    ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : - =\n    Q W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \\\n    A S D F G H J K L ; '\n    Z X C V B N M , . /\n    ```\n\n**5. Other Layouts (Less Common)**\n\n*   **ISO (International):**  Used primarily in Europe (excluding France and Belgium).  It has slightly different key placements.\n*   **Thai Keyboard Layout:**  Designed specifically for the Thai language.\n*   **Japanese, Korean, Chinese:**  Each has its own complex layouts, often using multiple input methods.\n\n**Key Differences Summarized:**\n\n| Layout       | Common Use         | Key Differences                               |\n|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| QWERTY       | Worldwide          | Original typewriter layout, less efficient    |\n| AZERTY       | France, Belgium     | Modified QWERTY, A/Q and W/Z key placement |\n| Dvorak       |  -                   | Most frequent letters on home row           |\n| Colemak      |  -                   |  More similar to QWERTY, easier to learn      |\n| ISO          | Europe (excluding France/Belgium) | Different key placement from QWERTY            |\n\n\n**Resources for Learning More:**\n\n*   **Wikipedia - Keyboard Layouts:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout)\n*   **Colemak.org:** [https://www.colemak.org/](https://www.colemak.org/) (Learn about and try the Colemak layout)\n*   **Keyman Developer:** [https://keyman.com/](https://keyman.com/) (A great resource for exploring different keyboard layouts and learning tools)\n\nTo help me give you even more targeted information, could you tell me:\n\n*   **What operating system are you using?** (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, etc.)\n*   **What language are you primarily typing in?**",
