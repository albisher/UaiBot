Uaibot: AI-Powered Learning Assistant - Project Plan

Project Goal: To create an engaging, AI-powered assistant named "Uaibot" to help users, particularly teenagers (13+) and older, learn command-line interactions, understand system operations, and serve as a general AI helper. Uaibot will be cross-platform, supporting macOS, Linux (including Jetson Nano Ubuntu), and Windows, featuring a friendly 2D avatar with programmatically drawn, expressive emotes, an embedded understanding of common CLI commands for each OS, advanced OS interaction capabilities, and a consistently formatted, visually appealing output.
I. Core Philosophy & Pedagogical Approach (Primarily for CLI & System Learning):
* Guided Discovery: Uaibot explains commands and system concepts in an age-appropriate (13+) way before (or after) execution, tailored to the specific OS. Output will be formatted for clarity (see Section VIII).
* Safety First & Ethical Use (Teenager Mode for CLI, Security Awareness):
   * Implement a "safe mode" for CLI interactions by default across all supported OS. This mode will have stricter controls and require more confirmations for potentially sensitive operations.
   * Restrict/warn about potentially destructive commands (e.g., rm -rf, sudo on POSIX systems, Format-Volume, Remove-Item -Recurse -Force on Windows), possibly requiring explicit override (perhaps with a typed confirmation phrase) or simulating outcomes rather than direct execution initially. AI assistance will be used in identifying risky commands for each OS.
   * Curate a list of safe, educational commands with OS-specific equivalents and explanations.
   * Integrate knowledge of cybersecurity concepts (e.g., Mitre ATT&CK TTPs) to explain risks and potentially identify/warn about series of user actions that could be harmful or unauthorized (see Section VII. Security).
* Engagement:
   * Avatar's emotions, rendered programmatically for a distinct robotic style, reflect interaction outcomes. The range of expressions will be inspired by common emoji and kaomoji semantics.
   * (Future consideration: Simple rewards/badges for learning, gamification elements like challenges or points for mastering commands or concepts).
* Progressive Learning: Start with basic commands and concepts, gradually introducing more complex ones as the user demonstrates understanding and successful usage on their specific OS. Uaibot may track commands used successfully to tailor future explanations and suggestions.
II. Core Technology Stack & Integration
* Shell Integration, OS Awareness, System Interaction & AI Models
   * Primary Language: Python (using venv for robust environment management during development and for packaging, ensuring dependencies are isolated).
   * OS Detection: Uaibot will detect the host operating system (e.g., using platform.system(), platform.release(), sys.platform) at startup and during runtime if necessary, to use appropriate commands, file paths, and interaction methods.
   * Cross-Platform Command Knowledge Base:
      * Uaibot will have an internal, structured knowledge base (e.g., JSON files, a simple database) containing common commands, their syntax, options, and functions for macOS (Zsh/Bash), Linux (Bash/Zsh and other common shells), and Windows (CMD/PowerShell). This includes understanding variations and equivalents (e.g., ls -la vs. Get-ChildItem -Force).
      * The AI model will be leveraged to understand user intent (from natural language queries) and map it to the correct command(s) from this knowledge base for the active OS.
   * If a command or concept is not found in the local knowledge base or cannot be handled by standard shell commands, Uaibot can leverage its AI for intent recognition and learning.
   * Shell Interaction: subprocess module in Python.
      * Security Note (Critical):
         * Prioritize using subprocess.run(['command', 'arg1', 'arg2'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=False) to execute commands. Arguments should be passed as a list to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.
         * Avoid shell=True whenever possible. If shell=True is deemed absolutely necessary for complex AI-suggested commands or shell-specific features (and this should be rare and heavily scrutinized):
            * These commands must be clearly presented to the user for explicit review and confirmation before execution, especially if they involve administrative privileges or data modification.
            * All parameters within such commands must be meticulously sanitized/quoted using OS-appropriate methods (e.g., shlex.quote for POSIX-like shells; careful handling for PowerShell/CMD special characters).
   * Advanced OS Interaction (Cross-Platform Libraries & OS-specific APIs):
      * File System Operations: Read from and write to files as requested by the user (e.g., "Uaibot, read the content of my_document.txt," "Uaibot, save this summary to notes.md"). This will use standard Python file I/O (open(), os module functions), always operating with appropriate permissions checks and clear feedback to the user about actions being taken. Safety checks will prevent overwriting important files without confirmation.
      * GUI Automation: Programmatically send keyboard strokes (e.g., typing text into an application) and mouse signals (move, click) to interact with other applications or the OS GUI.
         * Libraries like pyautogui (cross-platform with dependencies) or OS-specific solutions (e.g., AppleScript via osascript for macOS, pywinauto or Windows API via ctypes/pywin32 for Windows, Xlib/AT-SPI for Linux) will be investigated.
         * This functionality requires explicit, granular user permission for each type of action or target application and will include strong warnings about potential unintended consequences.
      * Screen Reading/Scraping: Ability to read text content from active windows or specified parts of the screen.
         * This may involve using Accessibility APIs (e.g., AX API on macOS, UI Automation on Windows, AT-SPI on Linux) or OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract via pytesseract) if direct text extraction is not possible.
         * This requires explicit user permission and clear indication of what is being read.
   * AI Model Access & Capabilities:
      * Local Models (Primary): Ollama, GPT4All, Open WebUI, etc., allowing users to run LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Phi) entirely on their machine for privacy and no subscription fees.
      * Cloud Models (Optional/Fallback): APIs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, or similar providers, accessed via their respective Python SDKs.
      * API Key Management for Cloud Models:
         * API keys must never be hardcoded into the source code.
         * Recommend storing API keys in environment variables (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY).
         * Alternatively, use a .env file (which must be added to .gitignore) loaded by a library like python-dotenv.
         * Provide clear, user-friendly instructions on how users can obtain and configure their own API keys if they choose to use cloud models.
      * Complex Problem Solving: Leverage the chosen AI model's reasoning capabilities to help users think through tasks that don't have clear, predefined command sequences, breaking them down into manageable steps or suggesting different approaches.
      * Internet Search Integration: For unknown commands, troubleshooting information, or general knowledge queries beyond the local LLM's training, Uaibot can be instructed to perform an internet search. This could be implemented using search engine APIs (e.g., Google Custom Search JSON API, Bing Search API - requiring API keys) or by controlling a headless browser instance (e.g., using Selenium or Playwright) to scrape search results. User consent will be required, and sources should be cited where possible.
   * Input Processing (Python Script):
      * Prioritize Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for user input (text or voice). This involves parsing the user's query to identify intents (e.g., "execute command," "explain concept," "find file," "automate GUI task") and entities (e.g., filenames, command names, parameters, application names).
      * Libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or even simpler regex-based parsing combined with LLM prompt engineering can be used.
      * Send structured input (parsed intent and entities, along with OS context and conversation history) to the AI for:
         * Intent recognition confirmation.
         * OS-aware command generation/selection/correction for CLI tasks.
         * Information retrieval for explanations.
         * Plan generation for GUI automation or complex tasks.
         * General question answering for non-CLI tasks.
   * Interaction Flows:
      * Natural Language Queries (e.g., "How do I list all text files in my documents folder on this Mac?"):
         1. AI interprets intent (list files) and entities (text files, documents folder, Mac OS).
         2. Uaibot identifies the OS (macOS), selects the appropriate command (e.g., find ~/Documents -name "*.txt" -print or mdfind -onlyin ~/Documents 'kMDItemKind == "Plain Text Document"') from its knowledge base or generates it, and explains it clearly (output formatted per Section VIII).
         3. Uaibot asks for confirmation: "This command should do what you asked. Do you want me to execute it?"
         4. On confirmation, executes and provides feedback (output formatted per Section VIII).
      * Direct Command Input (e.g., user types del myfile.txt on Linux):
         1. AI validates/corrects. If the command is for a different OS, Uaibot might say, "That looks like a Windows command (del). On Linux, the equivalent is usually rm. Did you mean rm myfile.txt?"
         2. If command is very unclear/wrong: Provide a short, easy hint or clarifying question relevant to the current OS (e.g., "I'm not familiar with lstree. Were you perhaps thinking of tree or ls with some options?").
         3. Execute (with potential confirmation for sensitive commands like rm) and provide feedback.
      * "Unknown" User Input (General Queries or Ambiguous Requests):
         * Avoid "I'm not sure" or "I can't help with that."
         * Proactively respond: "I think I understood you want to do [AI's best guess based on keywords and context, tailored to the current OS if applicable]... Is that right?" or "That's an interesting question! I can try to find information about that online, or perhaps you could rephrase it in terms of a system task or command?"
   * Uaibot's Role: Acts as a general AI helper (for Q&A, summarization, creative tasks), a cross-platform CLI/System learning assistant, an OS interaction tool, and a basic automation facilitator. The system will use context (conversation history, keywords, detected OS) to discern whether a query is CLI-related, OS interaction related, or a general knowledge/AI task.
* USB Appliance Control & IoT Interaction
   * Libraries: pyusb (requires libusb/OpenUSB), libusb1 Python bindings, pyserial. Ensure cross-platform compatibility of these libraries and their underlying drivers.
   * Purpose:
      * Learning about hardware interaction: Allow users to understand how software communicates with hardware devices.
      * Programming simple IoT devices: Guide users in sending/receiving data or commands to/from microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32/ESP8266, Raspberry Pi Pico, or a connected Jetson Nano (when Uaibot is running on a different host).
      * Testing serial communications: Provide an interface to list available serial ports, configure connection parameters (baud rate, parity, etc.), send data, and view received data.
      * Fun & Engagement: Simple interactions like controlling an LED or reading a sensor can be very engaging.
   * Interaction:
      * Users can describe the connected device: "Uaibot, I have an Arduino Uno connected. Can you help me find its serial port?" or "I want to send 'hello' to my ESP32 on /dev/ttyUSB0." or "This chip says 'CH340' and it's on a USB cable, how do I talk to it?"
      * Uaibot will guide them through:
         * Listing available serial ports (e.g., using pyserial.tools.list_ports).
         * Identifying the correct port for their device (may involve some trial and error or looking at device manager/system profiler output, which Uaibot could guide).
         * Explaining basic serial communication concepts.
         * Generating simple Python code snippets using pyserial to send/receive data.
         * Helping to upload pre-written firmware or simple scripts if tools like arduino-cli or esptool.py are installed and Uaibot is taught to use them.
   * Permissions: Accessing USB devices and serial ports requires appropriate permissions.
      * Linux: udev rules are critical. Uaibot should provide guidance on creating these (e.g., adding the user to the dialout or plugdev group, or specific rules for vendor/product IDs).
      * Windows: Drivers are usually required for USB-to-serial converters (CH340, FTDI, CP210x). Uaibot might guide users to find these. Application may need to run with sufficient privileges if accessing raw USB devices, though pyserial usually works at a higher level.
      * macOS: Drivers are often built-in for common chips, but some may require installs. Access to serial ports is generally straightforward. Raw USB access via pyusb might require more setup.
* Audio Input/Output
   * Management: Utilize OS-specific audio APIs or cross-platform libraries like sounddevice (which itself uses PortAudio, Core Audio, ALSA, etc.). For Linux, ensure compatibility with PulseAudio and PipeWire sound servers.
   * Programmatic I/O: sounddevice or pyaudio for capturing microphone input and playing audio output.
   * Speech Recognition (STT):
      * Primary library: speech_recognition (which supports multiple engines).
      * Engine choice:
         * Offline (Prioritized for privacy): vosk (good accuracy, multiple languages, requires model download), CMU Sphinx (via PocketSphinx). Resource usage (CPU, RAM, model size) is a key consideration.
         * Online/Cloud (Optional, higher accuracy for complex speech): Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Wit.ai, Azure Speech Services. Requires internet and API keys.
   * Text-to-Speech (TTS):
      * Engine choice:
         * Offline (Prioritized for privacy & responsiveness): pyttsx3 (cross-platform, uses native OS engines like SAPI5, NSSpeechSynthesizer, espeak), Piper (high-quality, fast, requires model download).
         * Online/Cloud (Optional, more natural voices): Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, Azure TTS. Requires internet and API keys.
   * User Experience for Voice:
      * Clear visual indicator when Uaibot is listening.
      * Mechanism for users to select microphone and speaker devices if multiple are available.
      * Ability to adjust STT sensitivity or choose language models if applicable.
      * Option to choose TTS voice and adjust speed/pitch.
      * Graceful handling of STT errors (e.g., "Sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you please repeat?").
* Graphical Window with Robotic Face/Avatar:
   * GUI Toolkit: PyQt5 or PySide2 (chosen for their comprehensive features, Python bindings, and cross-platform capabilities).
   * Avatar Style: 2D cartoonish robot, designed to be friendly and expressive. Examples like "Emo" robot provide stylistic direction (simple shapes, clear emotional cues).
   * Emote Rendering:
      * Primary Method: Emotes (facial expressions like eyes, mouth, eyebrows, simple accessory elements like sweat drops or question marks) will be drawn programmatically using the GUI toolkit's 2D drawing capabilities (e.g., QPainter in PyQt5/PySide2).
         * This allows for scalable vector graphics (no pixelation when resized).
         * Dynamic customization (e.g., changing eye color, line thickness, subtle animation of expressions programmatically at runtime).
         * Reduced application package size (no need to bundle numerous external image assets for emotes).
         * Potentially smoother animations than rapidly swapping image files.
      * Emote Design Inspiration: The range of expressions (e.g., neutral, happy, sad, thinking, confused, surprised, winking, listening, speaking, error/warning) will be inspired by common Unicode emoji semantics (e.g., 😀, 🤔, 😢, 😉) and Kaomoji expressiveness (e.g., (＾▽＾), (T_T), (・_・ヾ), but translated into a unique, stylized robotic appearance using simple geometric shapes (circles, ellipses, rectangles with rounded corners, lines, arcs).
      * Emote Logic: A dedicated Python module (e.g., avatar_emotes.py or a class within the GUI structure) will contain the functions or methods responsible for drawing each defined robotic emote. This module will be called by the main GUI logic to update the avatar's face based on Uaibot's current internal state (e.g., processing, listening, speaking) or the sentiment/nature of the AI output.
   * Emotions Mapping: The avatar's expressions will be clearly mapped to AI outputs (e.g., a positive AI response triggers a happy/smiling emote) and interaction states (e.g., a thinking face while waiting for AI, a listening animation when STT is active, a slightly concerned face for warnings). These mappings must be clear and intuitive, especially for younger users within the 13+ target range.

	IV. Key Steps (Iterative Development)
1. Foundation - OS Detection, AI & Core Shell Logic (Python with venv):
   * Implement reliable OS detection (platform module) and store OS context.
   * Set up and integrate a primary local LLM (e.g., Ollama with a suitable model).
   * Develop the core Python application structure, including venv setup scripts (requirements.txt).
   * Implement basic text input and parsing (NLU focus for intent/entity extraction).
   * Develop AI querying mechanisms (construct clear, contextualized prompts including OS info).
   * Develop the initial version of the cross-platform Command Knowledge Base (e.g., a few key commands for each OS).
   * Implement parsing of AI responses to extract commands, explanations, and general answers.
   * Implement basic interaction flows (e.g., natural language query -> AI -> command suggestion -> user confirmation -> execution).
   * Implement basic safe command execution using subprocess for each target OS, adhering to security guidelines.
   * Develop initial output formatting utilities (as defined in Section VIII) for consistent console/GUI text presentation.
2. Build the GUI & Basic Avatar Framework:
   * Create the main application window using PyQt5/PySide2.
   * Design and implement an initial set of core robotic emotes programmatically (e.g., neutral, thinking, happy, sad, listening, speaking) using QPainter in the avatar_emotes.py module or an equivalent class structure.
   * Integrate a basic avatar display area in the GUI and link its expressions to Uaibot's internal states (e.g., processing, idle, AI response received).
   * Ensure GUI output areas (e.g., text boxes, console-like views) can render formatted text, including emojis, as per Section VIII.
3. Basic Audio Output (TTS):
   * Integrate a chosen offline TTS engine (e.g., pyttsx3 or Piper) for Uaibot's voice responses.
4. Kid-Friendly (Teenager-Focused) Command Module & Safety:
   * Expand the Command Knowledge Base with more safe and educational commands for each OS, including kid-friendly (teen-appropriate) explanations and examples.
   * Implement the "safe mode" logic, including blocklists/allowlists for commands and confirmation prompts for potentially risky operations.
5. General AI Capability & Complex Reasoning:
   * Integrate internet search functionality (e.g., using a search API or browser automation) for Uaibot to find information about unknown commands or topics, with user consent.
   * Develop strategies for using LLMs for multi-step problem-solving (e.g., prompting techniques for breaking down complex user requests).
6. Advanced OS Interaction Module (Iterative, Per-Platform):
   * Implement basic file I/O operations (read/write text files) based on user requests, with safety checks and confirmations.
   * Prototype GUI automation (e.g., typing text into a specific, user-identified open window) for one OS first, then expand.
   * Prototype screen reading (e.g., extracting text from a user-specified window) for one OS first, then expand.
7. USB/IoT Interaction Module (Iterative):
   * Implement serial port detection and listing.
   * Enable basic serial communication (sending/receiving text data) through Uaibot.
   * Guide users to interact with a simple connected device (e.g., an Arduino sending sensor data or an LED controlled by serial commands).
8. Security - Mitre ATT&CK Integration (Basic):
   * Build a knowledge base of selected Mitre ATT&CK TTPs relevant to endpoint systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), focusing on common techniques.
   * Implement a mechanism for Uaibot to explain these TTPs in an understandable way when asked by the user.
   * (Advanced, Future R&D): Develop pattern matching or AI-assisted analysis for detecting obviously suspicious sequences of commands and providing educational warnings (not full EDR capability).
9. Iterate & Expand (Ongoing):
   * Add STT functionality for voice input.
   * Continuously refine and expand the library of programmatic robotic emotes for more nuanced expressions.
   * Continuously expand the cross-platform Command Knowledge Base and Mitre ATT&CK TTP database.
   * Refine output formatting based on user feedback and diverse content types.
   * Systematically implement and test OS interaction and USB/IoT features across all target platforms.
   * (Future) Develop learning "quests," challenges, or tutorials to guide users through specific learning paths.
V. Target Audience
* Users (especially teenagers aged 13+ and adult learners) wanting to learn command-line interface (CLI) usage, understand system operations, explore basic IoT/hardware concepts, and improve cybersecurity awareness on macOS, Linux (including Jetson Nano Ubuntu), or Windows.
* General users looking for an AI-powered desktop assistant with capabilities for information retrieval, task guidance, and basic automation on supported platforms.
VI. Use Cases
* Cross-Platform CLI & System Learning Assistant: Guides users through learning commands, file system navigation, process management, and other system concepts for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
* General AI Assistant: Answers general knowledge questions, provides explanations, summarizes text, assists with creative tasks (writing, brainstorming), and helps with complex problem-solving by breaking tasks down.
* Desktop Automation Tool (User-Guided): Automates repetitive tasks by controlling keyboard/mouse input to other applications, reading content from the screen, and interacting with files, all under explicit user instruction and permission.
* Web Information Retriever & Summarizer: Fetches and summarizes information from web pages or online searches when requested by the user.
* IoT & Hardware Interaction Helper: Guides users in connecting to, communicating with, and programming simple USB-connected devices like microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, etc.) and development boards (Jetson Nano).
* Programming Task Guidance (Conceptual & Snippets): Assists with understanding basic programming concepts (especially for Python and shell scripting), helps debug simple code, or generates small, illustrative code snippets for specific tasks (OS-aware for scripting, simple IoT interactions).
* Cybersecurity Awareness Tool: Explains cybersecurity concepts like those in the Mitre ATT&CK framework, helps users understand the purpose and potential risks of certain commands or system actions, and (in future iterations) may provide educational warnings about sequences of actions that resemble known TTPs.
VII. Additional Considerations
* Security
   * Input Sanitization (Critical & OS-Specific):
      * All user inputs that might be used to construct commands or file paths must be rigorously sanitized.
      * Avoid constructing shell commands by simple string concatenation with AI-generated or user input.
      * Prioritize using subprocess.run() with command and arguments passed as a list.
      * If shell=True is absolutely unavoidable (e.g., for complex shell pipelines suggested by AI and confirmed by the user), ensure the entire command string is reviewed by the user, and any interpolated parameters are meticulously quoted/escaped using OS-specific methods (shlex.quote for POSIX, careful handling for CMD/PowerShell metacharacters).
      * The "safe mode" blocklist/allowlist for commands must be OS-specific and regularly reviewed. It should include commands known for destructive potential or requiring high privileges.
   * API Key Management (for Cloud Services):
      * Store API keys securely using environment variables (preferred), a .env file (added to .gitignore and loaded at runtime), or a dedicated, permission-restricted configuration file.
      * Never hardcode API keys directly into the source code.
      * If the application is distributed, provide clear, user-friendly instructions for users on how to obtain and configure their own API keys for any optional cloud-based AI models or search services.
   * Permissions for OS Interaction (GUI Automation, Screen Reading, File Access):
      * These powerful features require explicit, granular user permissions. Uaibot must clearly explain what permissions it needs and why, before attempting such actions.
      * Implement robust confirmation dialogues before Uaibot takes control of mouse/keyboard or reads screen content outside its own window.
      * File system operations outside a clearly defined user workspace (e.g., a dedicated "Uaibot_Files" folder) should require specific confirmation.
      * Users should have an easily accessible way to review and revoke these permissions.
   * Mitre ATT&CK Integration & Reporting:
      * Uaibot's knowledge base will include information on selected Mitre ATT&CK TTPs, allowing it to explain these concepts to users in an educational context.
      * Detection of TTPs: This is an advanced and challenging feature. Initial implementation will focus on recognizing very obvious, predefined sequences of commands or actions that are strongly indicative of specific TTPs (e.g., multiple failed login attempts followed by a privilege escalation command). This is for educational warning, not for robust security monitoring.
      * Reporting/Warning: If a potentially suspicious pattern (based on these predefined rules or future AI-assisted analysis) is detected, Uaibot should:
         * Inform the user in a clear, non-alarming, educational manner.
         * Explain why the sequence of actions is flagged (e.g., "The commands you've just run are sometimes used in a technique called [TTP Name], which can be risky because...").
         * Avoid accusatory language. The goal is education and awareness.
         * (Optional, for future consideration with parental consent): A feature could allow for logging of such warnings for review by a parent or guardian if Uaibot is used by younger teens in a managed environment.
* Error Handling (Scenario Planning & Actionable Help):
   * Implement robust try-except blocks around all I/O operations, external API calls, command executions, and hardware interactions.
   * Anticipate and manage common error scenarios for each OS:
      * AI Model Interaction: API errors (rate limits, authentication failures, model unavailability, network issues), malformed/unexpected responses from LLM, local model loading failures (file not found, insufficient memory/VRAM, corrupted model files).
      * Shell Command Execution: Command not found (for the specific OS), permission denied (file access, command execution), command execution errors (non-zero exit codes), unexpected output formats, issues with pipes or redirections.
      * USB Device Control: Device not found/disconnected, driver issues (especially on Windows), permission errors (e.g., udev rules on Linux, macOS security prompts), communication timeouts, data corruption, pyserial or pyusb specific exceptions.
      * Audio I/O: Audio device not selected/available, microphone/speaker issues, library-specific errors (e.g., PortAudioError from sounddevice), STT/TTS engine failures.
      * GUI Operations: UI element interaction failures, rendering issues, event handling errors.
      * OS Interaction (GUI Automation/Screen Reading): Target window/element not found, permission denied by OS security features, unexpected UI changes in target applications.
   * User-Friendly Error Messages (Formatted per Section VIII):
      * Translate technical error messages and stack traces into simple, understandable language appropriate for a 13+ audience.
      * Explain what went wrong, and if possible, why it might have happened.
      * Provide actionable suggestions or troubleshooting steps. For example, if cd non_existent_folder fails:
         * "❌ Oops! It looks like the folder named 'non_existent_folder' doesn't exist in your current location (/path/to/current_directory).
         * 💡 Suggestions:
         * Double-check the spelling and capitalization. Folder names are often case-sensitive on macOS and Linux!
         * Use the ls (or dir on Windows) command to see the actual folders here.
         * Would you like to create a new folder named 'non_existent_folder' in this location?"
   * Actionable Help & Knowledge Base:
      * Beyond immediate suggestions, consider linking to relevant parts of an internal Uaibot help system or a curated list of online resources for common issues.
      * Maintain a small, searchable knowledge base or FAQ within Uaibot for common problems and their resolutions, tailored to the supported OS.
* Performance
   * Local LLMs:
      * Provide clear guidance in documentation and potentially within Uaibot itself on minimum and recommended system specifications (RAM, CPU cores, GPU VRAM if applicable) for running different types or sizes of local LLMs.
      * Explain that the choice of local LLM (e.g., smaller quantized models like a 3B Q4 vs. larger, more capable ones like a 7B Q8 or full precision models) significantly impacts performance, response quality, and resource consumption.
      * Consider an optional feature for Uaibot to check available system resources (RAM, VRAM) and warn the user if they attempt to load a local model that is likely to perform poorly or cause instability on their system.
   * General Python Code Optimization: Profile and optimize Python code for efficiency, especially in frequently called functions, loops, GUI rendering, and AI interaction routines to ensure a responsive user experience.
   * OS Interaction Overhead: Be mindful that GUI automation and screen reading can be resource-intensive and may impact system performance if not implemented carefully. Use efficient techniques and allow users to control the frequency or scope of these operations.
* UI/UX Design (Teenager-Focused & OS-Aware)
   * Visuals & Language:
      * Use clear, legible fonts. Ensure high contrast for text and UI elements to maintain accessibility.
      * Buttons and interactive elements should be easily clickable/tappable with sufficient padding.
      * Language used in explanations and prompts should be suitable for a 13+ audience – capable of understanding more technical detail than younger children, but still clear, concise, and avoiding unnecessary jargon.
      * Maintain a friendly, encouraging, and patient tone.
   * Avatar Visuals: The programmatically drawn robotic avatar's emotional expressions must be very clear, distinct, and easily understandable, fitting a clean, somewhat geometric but expressive style. Animations should be smooth and timely.
   * Output Presentation: All textual output from Uaibot (explanations, command results, error messages, general AI responses) must strictly adhere to the formatting guidelines in Section VIII to ensure clarity, readability, and a pleasant visual experience. This includes consistent use of whitespace, emojis (where appropriate in GUI), and dividers.
   * OS Indication: Uaibot might subtly indicate the OS context it's currently operating in (e.g., a small OS icon in the UI, or mentioning "On your Mac..." / "For Windows...") when providing OS-specific information or commands, especially if the user frequently switches contexts or asks comparative questions.
   * Responsiveness: The UI should remain responsive even when Uaibot is processing complex AI queries or performing background tasks. Use threading or asynchronous operations appropriately.
* User Experience & Setup
   * Initial Setup and Dependency Management (Cross-Platform):
      * Create a comprehensive README.md file with clear, step-by-step installation instructions for all target platforms (macOS, specific Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Windows).
      * Detail all prerequisites: Python version (and how to install/manage it, e.g., using pyenv), venv creation and activation, pip, and any non-Python dependencies (e.g., libusb for pyusb, PortAudio for sounddevice, build tools if compiling from source).
      * Provide platform-specific setup scripts (setup.sh for macOS/Linux, setup.bat or setup.ps1 for Windows) to automate dependency installation from requirements.txt and other setup tasks where feasible.
      * For local AI models (Ollama, etc.): Provide very clear instructions on how to install the model serving software, download model files, expected directory structures, and how to configure Uaibot to connect to them or find them.
      * Include troubleshooting tips for common setup issues on each platform.
   * USB udev / Driver Support (Cross-Platform):
      * Linux: Provide example udev rules templates for common scenarios (e.g., granting user access to serial devices or specific USB vendor/product IDs). Include clear, step-by-step instructions (or a helper script segment) for users to identify their USB device's vendor/product IDs (e.g., using lsusb) and correctly install/reload the udev rules. Explain the importance of group memberships like dialout or plugdev.
      * Windows: Guide users on checking Device Manager for USB-to-serial drivers (CH340, FTDI, CP210x, etc.) and finding/installing them if missing. Explain potential issues with driver signing.
      * macOS: Note that many common USB serial drivers are built-in. For less common devices or raw USB access, explain if any specific drivers or configuration (like disabling SIP temporarily for certain unsigned kernel extensions, with strong warnings) might be needed, though this should be avoided if possible.
* Child Safety and Parental Controls (Adjusted for 13+):
   * While the target audience is 13+, features like unrestricted internet search, advanced GUI automation, and broad file system access still warrant consideration for optional parental oversight or configurable limits, depending on the family's digital safety preferences.
   * Uaibot should promote responsible AI use and digital citizenship through its interactions and explanations.
   * Content filtering for AI-generated text (especially from cloud models or web searches) should be implemented to minimize exposure to inappropriate or harmful content. This might involve using moderation APIs or prompt engineering techniques.
   * Consider an optional "focus mode" that restricts certain advanced features if a parent/guardian wishes to limit Uaibot to more educational/foundational tasks initially.
* Architectural Planning
   * Modularity: Design Uaibot with clear, stable interfaces between major components (e.g., AI model interaction layer, command execution engine, OS-specific interaction modules, GUI, USB communication module, avatar rendering, output formatter). This facilitates:
      * Easier testing and debugging of individual parts.
      * Independent development and updates of components.
      * Future flexibility to swap out implementations (e.g., trying a different GUI toolkit, adding a new local LLM type, or a new USB device protocol).
      * Example: An abstract AIModelProvider base class that different local and cloud-based models can implement. An OSInteraction base class with platform-specific derived classes.
   * Configuration Management: Use configuration files (e.g., INI, JSON, YAML) for settings like API keys (paths to them, not keys themselves), default model choices, feature flags, UI preferences, etc., rather than hardcoding.
   * Logging: Implement comprehensive logging (e.g., using Python's logging module) with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to help with development, debugging, and understanding user issues. Allow users to easily access/share logs for support.
   * Platform-Specific Code:
      * Organize OS-dependent code into clearly separated modules or packages (e.g., uaibot.platforms.linux, uaibot.platforms.windows, uaibot.platforms.macos).
      * Each platform module would contain specific implementations for CLI command knowledge, GUI automation hooks, screen reading, USB quirks, etc.
      * Use runtime OS detection (platform.system()) to dynamically load or call the appropriate platform-specific modules or functions, employing strategy or factory design patterns where suitable.
* Platform Support (macOS, Linux/Jetson Nano, Windows)
   * Ensure all chosen core Python libraries and dependencies are actively maintained and compatible with the target versions of macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon ARM64), various common Linux distributions (x86_64/ARM64, including Ubuntu for Jetson Nano), and Windows (x86_64, ARM64 if feasible and libraries support it).
   * Actively test the application builds and key features on physical or virtualized instances of all target platforms and architectures throughout the development lifecycle.
   * Document any known limitations, OS-specific behaviors, or required workarounds for each platform in the README.md or user documentation.
   * Pay special attention to platform differences in file paths, permissions models, available system utilities, and GUI rendering.
VIII. UaiBot Output Formatting and Presentation Guidelines
This section outlines the principles for formatting Uaibot's textual output to ensure a clear, intuitive, visually pleasing, and accessible user experience. These guidelines apply to all forms of output, including command explanations, execution results, error messages, and general AI responses.
* 1. Whitespace Balance Principles:
   * 1.1. Vertical Spacing:
      * Section Separation: Use double line breaks (or equivalent visual spacing in a GUI, like increased padding between QWidgets) to separate major logical sections of output.
      * Logical Grouping: Use single line breaks to group related items or thoughts within a section (e.g., a paragraph of explanation followed by a list of options).
      * Progressive Disclosure/Hierarchy: Use indentation (e.g., 2-4 spaces, or nested GUI layouts) to show hierarchical relationships or nested information (e.g., details under a main point, items in a bulleted or numbered list, sub-steps in a procedure).
   * 1.2. Horizontal Spacing:
      * Consistent Padding: Add 1-2 spaces around punctuation (like after commas or colons) or between distinct elements on a line where appropriate to avoid a cramped look and improve scannability.
      * Column Alignment: For tabular data (e.g., listing files with details, process lists) or key-value pairs (e.g., system information), strive for left-alignment for text labels and right-alignment for numeric values where it enhances readability. Ensure consistent starting points for columns using fixed-width principles or GUI table widgets.
      * Field Separation: Use consistent spacing (e.g., a colon followed by a space, or a defined tab stop/column width) between labels and their corresponding values (e.g., "CPU Usage: 45%").
   * 1.3. Visual Dividers (Use Sparingly and Purposefully):
      * Full-width dividers (e.g., a line of ─ characters in console, or a QFrame with HLine shape in PyQt): Use for separating very distinct major sections if double line breaks are insufficient to convey the separation (e.g., between a system report and a list of actions).
      * Partial dividers (e.g., ───── or ····· in console): Use for subsection separation if needed, but often good vertical spacing and clear headers are preferable. Avoid overuse.
      * Box drawing characters (e.g., ╭───╮, │, ╰───╯ in console, or styled QGroupBox/QFrame in GUI): Can be used to encapsulate distinct blocks of information like system reports, error details, or code snippets, especially in a terminal-like GUI display area.
* 2. Emoji Usage Guidelines (Primarily for GUI/Rich Text Output; Use Conservatively in Plain Text):
   * 2.1. Functional Categorization: Maintain a consistent internal mapping of emojis to specific functions or information types to create a predictable visual language. This mapping should be defined in a central place (e.g., an emoji_map.py or a dictionary). Examples:
      * Status: ✅ (Success), ⚠️ (Warning), ❌ (Error/Failure), 🔄 (In Progress/Loading/Processing), 💡 (Information/Tip/Hint), 🟢 (Online/Active/Connected), 🟡 (Pending/Issue/Attention), 🔴 (Offline/Critical Error/Disconnected).
      * Object Types: 💻 (Computer/System/OS), 📱 (Device - generic), 💾 (Disk/Storage), 📁 (Folder/Directory), 📄 (File/Document), 📝 (Text/Note), 🌐 (Network/Internet), 🔌 (USB/Connection).
      * Actions: ▶️ (Run/Start/Execute), ⏹️ (Stop/Cancel), 🔍 (Search/Find), ⚙️ (Settings/Configuration), ❓ (Help/Question), 💬 (Message/Output from Uaibot).
      * Cybersecurity: 🛡️ (Security/Protection), 🔑 (Key/Password/Authentication), 🔓 (Unlocked/Vulnerable - use with care), 📈 (Analysis/Report).
   * 2.2. Placement Consistency:
      * Prefix for Categories/Headers: Emojis can effectively prefix section headers or categories in GUI output (e.g., "⚙️ System Settings," "📁 File Operations").
      * Status Indicators: Place status emojis at the beginning of status lines, messages, or list items to provide an immediate visual cue (e.g., "✅ Command successful!", "⚠️ Low disk space.").
      * Action Association: In a GUI, emojis can be associated with buttons or actionable items to make them more visually distinct (e.g., a play button with ▶️).
   * 2.3. Density and Appropriateness:
      * Clarity First: Emojis should enhance clarity and scannability, not clutter the interface or distract the user. If an emoji's meaning is ambiguous in context, prefer text.
      * Avoid Overuse: Do not use multiple emojis for the same concept in a single message block. Generally, one well-chosen emoji per distinct piece of information, status, or list item is sufficient. Avoid "emoji salads."
      * Target Audience (13+): Ensure emojis are universally understood and appropriate for teenagers and adult learners. Avoid overly childish or obscure emojis.
      * Accessibility: Be mindful that emojis might not be rendered correctly on all systems or be interpreted accurately by screen readers. For critical information, ensure the meaning is clear from the text itself, with the emoji acting as a visual enhancement. Consider providing options to reduce or disable emojis for users who prefer a text-only experience or use assistive technologies. For purely textual terminal output (if Uaibot ever runs in such a mode), emoji use should be much more conservative and rely on widely supported Unicode characters.
* 3. Implementation Recommendations:
   * Formatting Utility Functions: Develop centralized Python functions within Uaibot's codebase for applying consistent formatting to different types of output. Examples:
      * def format_header(text: str, emoji: str = None, level: int = 1) -> str:
      * def format_list_item(text: str, indent_level: int = 1, emoji: str = None) -> str:
      * def format_error_message(title: str, details: list[str], suggestions: list[str] = None) -> str:
      * def format_table(headers: list[str], rows: list[list[str]]) -> str:
   * Emoji Dictionary/Manager: Maintain a Python dictionary or a small class (e.g., UaibotEmojis) to manage the mapping of semantic concepts (like "success," "warning," "file") to specific emoji characters. This ensures consistency and makes it easy to update or customize the emoji set.
   * String Alignment and Padding: Utilize Python's f-strings and string methods (.ljust(), .rjust(), .center()) for creating well-aligned text, especially for console-like output or when preparing data for tabular display in a GUI.
   * Terminal Width Awareness (for CLI-like display areas in GUI): If Uaibot has a dedicated output area that mimics a terminal, use shutil.get_terminal_size() (if running a true console backend for some reason) or, more likely, get the width of the relevant GUI widget to adapt line wrapping, table column widths, and full-width divider lengths for optimal display.
   * GUI Rendering: For GUI elements (like QTextEdit, QLabel in PyQt5/PySide2), leverage their rich text capabilities (HTML subset support) to render formatted text, including different font weights (bold for headers), colors (sparingly, e.g., red for critical errors, green for success, blue for links/commands), and inline display of emojis if supported well by the font and rendering engine. Ensure custom fonts used (if any) have good emoji coverage.
By adhering to these detailed output formatting guidelines, Uaibot's interactions will be significantly more professional, readable, engaging, and user-friendly across all its functionalities and supported platforms.
